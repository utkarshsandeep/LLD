Chain Of Responsibility Design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object
to pass a request along a chain of handlers.
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or
to pass it along the chain.

Example:
    - ATM Dispense Machine
    - Logging
    - Exception Handling
    - Security
    - Authentication
    - etc.
