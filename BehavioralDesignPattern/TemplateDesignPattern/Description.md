Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of
an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the
algorithm without changing its structure.

It has three main participants:
1. AbstractClass: The superclass that defines the template method.
2. ConcreteClass: The subclass that implements the specific steps of the algorithm.
3. Client: The object that uses the template method to execute the algorithm.

Template Design Pattern is used when you want to define the structure of an algorithm.
