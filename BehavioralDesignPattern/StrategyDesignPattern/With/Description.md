Here with using Strategy design pattern we can see that code duplicacy is
removed and we can use same piece of code multiple times with different vehicles.

Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.
It allows the client to choose the algorithm at runtime.

It has the following participants:
1. Context: The class that contains a reference to the Strategy interface.
2. Strategy: The interface that defines the algorithm.
3. ConcreteStrategy: The class that implements the Strategy interface.

Strategy Design Pattern example:
1. Payment Methods: Different payment methods can be implemented using the Strategy pattern.
2. Sorting Algorithms: Different sorting algorithms can be implemented using the Strategy pattern.
