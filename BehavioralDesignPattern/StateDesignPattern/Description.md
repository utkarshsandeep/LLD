State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object
to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

It has three main participants:
1. Context: The class that contains the state.
2. State: The interface that defines the behavior of the state.
3. ConcreteState: The class that implements the behavior of the state.

State Design Pattern is used when you want an object to change its behavior based on its internal state.
It is useful when you have an object that can be in multiple states and you want to avoid
using conditional statements to change its behavior.

Examples of State Design Pattern:
1. Traffic Lights: Traffic lights change their behavior based on the state of the traffic.
2. Vending Machines: Vending machines change their behavior based on the availability of products.
3. Game Characters: Game characters change their behavior based on their health or energy levels.
