It is used to create objects without coupling to the concrete class.
It is used to create objects without using the copy constructor.

Creational Design Pattern has the following participants:
1. Product: The interface that defines the common methods for the ConcreteProduct classes.
2. ConcreteProduct: The class that implements the Product interface.
3. Factory: The interface that defines the common methods for the ConcreteFactory classes.
4. ConcreteFactory: The class that implements the Factory interface to create the ConcreteProduct objects.
5. Client: The class that uses the Factory interface to create the ConcreteProduct objects.

Creational Design Pattern has the following types:
1. Factory Method Design Pattern
2. Abstract Factory Design Pattern
3. Singleton Design Pattern
