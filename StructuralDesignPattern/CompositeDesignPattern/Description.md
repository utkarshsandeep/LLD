Composite Design pattern is a structural design pattern that composes
objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

It has four main participants:
1. Component: The interface that defines the common methods for the leaf and composite classes.
2. Leaf: The class that represents the leaf nodes in the tree structure.
3. Composite: The class that represents the composite nodes in the tree structure.
4. Client: The class that uses the Component interface to interact with the Leaf and Composite classes.
