To update the properties in real time without using multiple classes for multiple
combinations we use decorator design pattern.
Decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.

It is different from Adapter Design Pattern in the sense that in Adapter Design Pattern the
client has the control over the interface that needs to be adapted,
while in Decorator Design Pattern the client has control over the properties that need to be
added to the object.

Decorator Design Pattern has the following participants:
1. Component: The interface that defines the properties that can be added to the object.
2. ConcreteComponent: The class that implements the Component interface.
3. Decorator: The class that implements the Component interface and adds the properties to the object.
4. ConcreteDecorator: The class that extends the Decorator class to add the properties to the object.
5. Client: The class that uses the Component interface to interact with the ConcreteComponent and ConcreteDecorator classes.

Decorator Design Pattern is used when you want to add properties to an object at runtime.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object without changing its source code.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added or removed at runtime.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be combined in multiple ways.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any order.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any combination.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any sequence.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any quantity.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any number of times.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any frequency.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any interval.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any duration.
It is used when you want to add properties to an object that can be added in any period.
