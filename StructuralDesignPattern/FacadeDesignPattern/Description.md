Facade design pattern is used when we want to hide the system complexities from the client
and create an interface to interact with the system.
Facade can use multiple classes to perform the operation.
Facade can use Facade design pattern as per the requirement.

Facade Design Pattern has the following participants:
1. Facade: The class that provides a simple interface to interact with the system.
2. Subsystem: The classes that implement the system functionalities.
3. Client: The class that uses the Facade interface to interact with the Subsystem classes.
