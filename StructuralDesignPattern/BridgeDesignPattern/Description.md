Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern used to decouple an abstraction
from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
This means that the implementation can be changed without affecting the abstraction
and vice versa. The bridge pattern is useful when both the abstraction and implementation
need to be extended independently.

It is different from Strategy Design Pattern in the sense that in Strategy pattern
the client has the control over the algorithm that needs to be used, while in Bridge Design
Pattern the client has control over the abstraction and the implementation.
