Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
It has four main participants:
1. Target: The interface that defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses.
2. Adapter: The class that adapts the Adaptee to the Target interface.
3. Adaptee: The class that has the interface that needs to be adapted.
4. Client: The class that uses the Target interface to interact with the Adaptee.
Adapter Design Pattern is used when you want to use an existing class with an incompatible interface.
It is used when you want to make two incompatible interfaces work together without changing
their source code.
It allows you to reuse existing classes with different interfaces without modifying their source code.
It is used when you want to create a reusable class that can work with multiple classes
with different interfaces.
